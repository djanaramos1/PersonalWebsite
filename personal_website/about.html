        About Me (Personally)
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Djana Ramos. I was born and raised in Chicago, IL where I currently reside. I have four daughters.
        No pets. The last time we had a pet I did all of the work despite some heavy convincing and negotiations prior 
        to getting the pet. I love to travel. I have traveled to three continents and several countries thus far.  My favorite
        place I've been so far has to be Dubai. I consider myself a Disney adult. I love all things Disney from Disney World, to 
        Disneyland, to Disney on Ice, to Disney cruises. I also enjoy all things Harry Potter. I am a Slytherin. I enjoy cooking, audiobooks, 
        and enjoying time with friends and family. I consider myself to be a free spirited jokester who loves to laugh.
    </p>

        About Me (Professionally)
    </h1>
    <p>
        I have spent more than 20 years in the health care industry. Initially I went to school for nursing. 
        I transitioned from nursing to medical coding. After spending more than a decade in medical coding, I advanced
        to auditing and then on to DRG validation. Throughout this time in the health care field, I developed a desire for software
        engineering. A desire I would soon pursue completely and whole-heartedly.  I enjoy creating, developing, implementing, and 
        fixing.
